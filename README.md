# Attitudes-and-behavioural-segmentation-for-COVID-19-in-Somalia

A people based segmentation on COVID-19 around attitudes and behaviours of Somalis. 

Data source, World Bank June 2020 survey --> https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/4077/related-materials.

All information on sampling methods, sampling size and weighting can be found on the link above.


Work currently carried out:
1 - Data cleaning/engineering
2 - Ran clustering algorithms on selected belief and behaviour variables
3 - Observed age differentiated clusters with similar behaviour and beliefs with correlates with known information

Further work:
1 - To include more input variables, standardise the variables and observe profiles
2 - Run classification models to look at associations between clusters and variables
3 - Assess cluster predictability and robustness
4 - Write report on policy implications
