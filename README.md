# COVID-19-Somalia-Segmentation

A people based segmentation on COVID-19 around attitudes and behaviours of Somalis. 

The aim is to understand how behaviours linked to reduction in transmission are percieved by Somalis and derive profiles within the population with information on attitudes, beliefs and socio-demographics to help target interventions more effectively.

Data source, World Bank June 2020 survey --> https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/4077/related-materials.

All information on sampling methods, sampling size and weighting can be found on the link above.


Work currently carried out:
- Data cleaning/engineering
- Ran clustering algorithms on selected belief and behaviour variables
- Observed age differentiated clusters with similar behaviour and beliefs with correlates with known information

Further work:
- To include more input variables, standardise the variables and observe profiles
- Run classification models to look at associations between clusters and variables
- Assess cluster predictability and robustness
- Write report on policy implications
