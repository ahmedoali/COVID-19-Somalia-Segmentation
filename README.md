# COVID-19-Somalia-Segmentation

A people based segmentation on COVID-19 around attitudes and behaviours of Somalis. 

The aim is to understand how behaviours linked to reduction in transmission are percieved by Somalis and derive profiles within the population with information on attitudes, beliefs and socio-demographics to help target interventions more effectively.

Data source, World Bank June 2020 survey --> https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/4077/related-materials.

All information on sampling methods, sampling size and weighting can be found on the link above.


Current work and findings:
- Data cleaning/engineering - recoding, standardising and creation of new variables
- Ran clustering algorithms on selected belief and behaviour variables
- Observed clusters with differing behaviour and beliefs
- Observed a low amount of variation in answers especially for the scaled opinion questions 

Further work:
- Run classification models to look at associations between clusters and variables
- Assess cluster predictability and robustness
- Write report on policy implications
